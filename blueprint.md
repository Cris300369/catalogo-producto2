# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This is a simple Flutter counter application with a visually appealing interface. It allows users to increment a counter, reset it, and receive a confirmation prompt when the count reaches a certain limit.

## Features

*   **Increment Counter:** Users can increment the counter by tapping a floating action button.
*   **Reset Counter:** Users can reset the counter to zero using a button in the app bar.
*   **Confirmation Alert:** When the counter reaches 20, a confirmation dialog is displayed to ask the user if they want to continue counting.
*   **Stylish UI:** The application features a gradient background, a blurred glass effect for the counter display, and custom fonts.

## Project Structure

*   `lib/main.dart`: The main entry point of the application, containing the UI and logic.
*   `pubspec.yaml`: Defines project dependencies, including `google_fonts` for custom typography.
*   `test/widget_test.dart`: Contains basic widget tests for the application.
